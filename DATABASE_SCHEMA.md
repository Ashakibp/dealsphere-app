## Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Soft References vs Hard Foreign Keys**
- Most relationships use hard foreign keys for data integrity
- Some fields (like `brokerId` in Deal) are optional to support direct deals

### 2. **JSON Fields for Flexibility**
- `metadata` in Activity for extensible data
- `configuration` in AI Users for settings
- `tradelines`, `inquiries` in CreditReport for complex nested data

### 3. **Enum Strategy**
- Extensive use of enums for type safety
- Prevents invalid states
- Clear business logic flow

### 4. **Audit Trail**
- Activity model provides comprehensive audit trail
- All major actions logged
- Supports compliance requirements

### 5. **Multi-tenancy**
- Organization-based data isolation
- Every entity tied to organization
- Enables SaaS model

### 6. **AI Integration**
- AI agents as special users
- AI insights as first-class entities
- Supports hybrid human/AI workflows

## Performance Considerations

### Indexes Added:
```prisma
@@index([type, status, scheduledAt])  // Activity - for task queries
@@index([userId, createdAt])          // Activity - for user feed
@@index([dealId, createdAt])          // Activity - for deal history
@@index([from, to, sentAt])           // Email - for conversation queries
@@index([threadId])                   // Email - for threading
@@index([from, to, status])           // Text/Phone - for communication queries
```

### Recommended Additional Indexes:
```prisma
// Add to Deal model
@@index([status, organizationId])
@@index([merchantId, status])

// Add to Payment model  
@@index([dealId, status])
@@index([dueDate, status])

// Add to Merchant model
@@index([organizationId, status])
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Password Storage**: Uses bcrypt hashing
2. **Data Isolation**: Organization-based separation
3. **Role-Based Access**: User roles control permissions
4. **Audit Trail**: All actions tracked in Activity
5. **PII Protection**: Sensitive data properly marked

## Scalability Notes

1. **Pagination**: All list queries should use limit/offset
2. **Eager Loading**: Use includes wisely to avoid N+1
3. **Background Jobs**: Heavy operations should be queued
4. **Caching**: Consider Redis for frequently accessed data
5. **Read Replicas**: Database can be scaled horizontally
